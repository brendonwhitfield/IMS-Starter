# QA-Fundamental-Project- IMS System 
This repository contains my IMS project constructed using concepts explored in the QA training course.

## Getting Started
The project began with a design brief exploring what was needed within the IMS. The main features were CRUD functionality and customer, items and order features. We were also informed to use jira with a kanban board for planning and updating, git for version control, ERD diagrams, a risk assesment wiht matrix and mySQL to store the databases. I've explored my coverage of these further within my presentation and my slides are present on github.

### Prerequisites
to develop the project, a prior knowledge of development concepts was required. We covered this in the week leading up to the project.
-Javs
-mySQL
-Git
-Agile
-VersionControl

### Installing

To setup your own IMS, you will need to:
A)fork the repository on github
B)open in your local IDE such as eclipse
C)connect your mySQL with your IDE by entering the db.properties class and changing the host and password to your personal settings.


## Running the tests

Due to issues encountered I never managed to complete tests, I began JUnit tests of my items tables but ran out of time to complete them.

### Unit Tests 

A unit test is a type of class that allows you to create methods to test methods/units within the corresponding class your trying to test.

This is an example of the functional skeleton test for 'Customer':
